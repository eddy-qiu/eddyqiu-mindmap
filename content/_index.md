This is the start of my garden/e-brain! Basically, I can help structure my thoughts, ideas, and learning by having it available in a inter-connected format that isalso viewable by the whole world. This is like a portfolio website, personal website, informative website, and more, all in one!

Here is some content that I will get started getting used to this new environment with, which by the way is supported by Obsidian and Quartz.

Now that there is some sort of connection, here are some topics that I am interested in writing up about to expand my "garden":
Self-improvement
Lean startups
Learning to build
