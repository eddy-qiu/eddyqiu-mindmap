Right now I am a computer science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. Right now, I am discovering my path and am currently interested in becoming a software engineer, product manager, or found my own startup.

Keep track of my internships [here](Internships.md).

Of course, as a student, I still have to go through the processes of University.
