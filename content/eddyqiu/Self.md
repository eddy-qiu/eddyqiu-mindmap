I think that the idea of "self" is really important, since you are the main character of your own story, you should give yourself the best opportunities while feeling the best.

In order to do so, there are many things I do in my life. One main part is biohacking/physical aspects. A simple example of this would be going to the gym to get stronger, more confident, and achieve better looks. As you get deeper down into various [[Rabbitholes]], the more information there is to pursue and the harder it is to organize everything. I'm not sure what my brain mapping will achieve as of now, because I am simply writing my thoughts down, but I think that someday it might provide some value to people going down different paths and with different interests. Only time will tell.
