- a basis for Push Down Automata and Turing Machines
- recall Regex
	- Alphabet
	- Concatenation
	- Branching (Union)
	- Repetition (Kleene Closure)
	- Definition of Regex:
		- | $\emptyset$
		- | $\epsilon$
		- | $\delta$
		- | R$_1$R$_2$
		- | R$_1$ | R$_2$
		- | R$_1$*
- Deterministic (DFA) vs. Non-deterministic (NFA)
	- Non is easier to create because it includes all paths while deterministic is very linear and you know where you are at all times
	- Every DFA is an NFA, but not every NFA is a DFA
	- DFAs take more space
- Constructing machine with Regex base cases
	- you can combine base case machines by joining the last step and first step of machines, or an $\epsilon$ transition (makes it NFA)
- FSM(edges, nodes, yes nodes, start node, alphabet)
	- $\Sigma$ = alphabet
	- Q = List of nodes
	- q $\in$ Q starting state
	- F = list of yes states
	- $\delta$ = transitions (edges)

	- basis: combine states to represent possible NFA states
	- subset algorithm (requires two functions)
		- **$\epsilon$-closure**
			- which states can I get to using only $\epsilon$ transitions
			- can always reach self
		- **Move**
			- which states can I get to using one symbol transition
			- could be none
