I am currently interning with Van Metre Companies as a Database Software Engineer this summer 2023. I might also return part time during the school year to gain more experience while earning money.

In order to be competitive for software engineering internships for next year, I have to make sure to study with [[Leetcode]]

Right now it is July 25, 2023, but I have already started to prepare and apply for summer 2024 internships. Right now it is mostly bigger companies and big hedge funds that are looking for interns (which I have almost 0 shot at) but I have made sure to apply to a lot of positions/programs that will maximize my chances.
