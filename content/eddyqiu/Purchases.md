I've decided to create this page to just list out some purchases that I have gotten recently and write if it was worth it or not. I will also add a wish list, and then reflect on purchasing them.

Recent purchases:
Airpods Pro 2 - worth it coming from airpods 2, the noise cancellation is very nice and they fit nice in the ear. Might want to get some hooks if I want to do running/cardio in them without falling out.

Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen - just got, pretty happy for the replacement so far as my old watch broke. Seeing how well it helps me and also if the battery life/build is good.
