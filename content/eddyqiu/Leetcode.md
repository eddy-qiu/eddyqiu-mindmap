In order to keep me accountable, I am going to start logging my Leetcode studies here. As of today, July 24, 2023, I have always been trying to commit to Leetcode and have only done a handful of problems.

Right now, I often take a long time with problems as well as understanding the solutions, and sometimes even have to learn python syntax.

- Completed [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/) problem - reattempt in a week
	- Bucket sort
	- python range(start, end, increment)

Some tools that I am using now are just Leetcode and Neetcode (free version). I might possibly get a premium course but I don't think that is too big of a requirement. I might also purchase Leetcode Premium in order to get company specific questions when I interview.

Shit is getting real now. Just got JP Morgan Hackerrank OA, very nervous for it and definitely need a lot of prep for it. Filtering Leetcode with extension right now but may get Premium, will practice a lot of easies until probably Saturday and then YOLO it.

[1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits/description/)
Attempt this one again in two days.
Approach - bucket sort

I'be kinda been taking a break recently 😅 due to having completed an OA recently. However, I have to stay on the grind, as a lot of other opportunities and things will pop up soon that I will have to be exceedingly ready with.

WE BACK. Finally back in the grind mindset - imma try to cop a good internship through PURE SKILLS.
Valid parentheses: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/submissions/1018073150/
Finished this problem in under 30 mins? A bit slow and had to take care of a lot of bugs. Used a stack for this problem. According to Neetcode, this could be optimized a little better with maps (python dicts).

Attempted Valid Palindrome again, try again tomorrow. ord() in python returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Strategy: comment the steps btw - create a pointer to the end and beginning of the string, traverse using while until the character is one of the valid ones, keep checking until the pointers are equal.
