In order to keep me accountable, I am going to start logging my Leetcode studies here. As of today, July 24, 2023, I have always been trying to commit to Leetcode and have only done a handful of problems.

Right now, I often take a long time with problems as well as understanding the solutions, and sometimes even have to learn python syntax.

- Completed [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/) problem - reattempt in a week
	- Bucket sort
	- python range(start, end, increment)

Some tools that I am using now are just Leetcode and Neetcode (free version). I might possibly get a premium course but I don't think that is too big of a requirement. I might also purchase Leetcode Premium in order to get company specific questions when I interview.

Shit is getting real now. Just got JP Morgan Hackerrank OA, very nervous for it and definitely need a lot of prep for it. Filtering Leetcode with extension right now but may get Premium, will practice a lot of easies until probably Saturday and then YOLO it.

[1356.Â Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits/description/)
Attempt this one again in two days.
Approach - bucket sort

I'be kinda been taking a break recently ðŸ˜… due to having completed an OA recently. However, I have to stay on the grind, as a lot of other opportunities and things will pop up soon that I will have to be exceedingly ready with.

WE BACK. Finally back in the grind mindset - imma try to cop a good internship through PURE SKILLS.
Valid parentheses: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/submissions/1018073150/
Finished this problem in under 30 mins? A bit slow and had to take care of a lot of bugs. Used a stack for this problem. According to Neetcode, this could be optimized a little better with maps (python dicts).

Attempted Valid Palindrome again, try again tomorrow. ord() in python returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Strategy: comment the steps btw - create a pointer to the end and beginning of the string, traverse using while until the character is one of the valid ones, keep checking until the pointers are equal.

Hahaha.... purchased Leetcode premium! I will try to keep up with doing problems everyday to make it worth it. Consistency is key. Today I attempted https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/submissions/ but still had some problems brainstorming solutions. I will attempt again tomorrow. 

Solution: When buying and selling a stock, we can have some sort of dynamic programming idea where we store the lowest cost day (memo). Then, we just find the the biggest difference in the days until we find another lowest cost day. Though we might not find a better profit after the lowest cost, we will have already stored the best profit from before (dynamic programming!).

Note: Taking CMSC389O, I have done a couple other leetcode problems, so I haven't really been slacking (I have). I should upload them tomorrow just to keep track of them in leetcode (and to also see the number go up).
