I'm Eddy Qiu, a computer science major graduating in Spring of 2025. This past summer I interned at Van Metre Companies, which is a real estate firm located in Fairfax, Virginia. I worked on the database team to help support and develop their on-site and cloud databases, which store pertinent information for the real estate, accounting, and bookkeeping aspects of their business. My work was primarily updating old scripts and creating new scripts to manipulate the data and make queries more efficient. Now I'm back at school, and one of my notable roles is the Tech Lead for the Maryland Undergraduate Research Journal, where I oversee management of the website. I'm really excited to share my experiences and learn more about the role and your experiences!\n\n**Describe a situation where a teammate was unable to finish their work.**\n\nMy business honors class not very technical, unlike my computer science classes, and our work consists mostly of analysis and group projects. For one presentation on how a company would utilize AI for their business in the future, I was grouped up with several peers. We created a group chat and set up a time to meet in order to collaborate on the project, but when it came time to meet, there was a member who did not show up at all, even after us reminding him in the group chat. Since we had planned earlier to split up the work, we suddenly extra work to do. Chasing a good grade on the project, I volunteered to work on it, and some of my other team members also volunteered to help out. In the end, I don't think the teammate was penalized, but the rest of my team and I did gain even more teamwork and communication skills as a result.\n\nhttps://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview\nQuestions to ask interviewer:\n1. Why did you want to work for this company?\n2. How can someone be successful in the position?\n3. What is your favorite part about working at this company?\n4. What are some example projects of past interns?\n5. What's the culture like between interns and the other employees?\n6. Do interns choose their own project to pursue, or are they assigned to already existing projects?\n\nWhy...\nSoFi\nPersonal finance has always been an interest of mine. Throughout high school and college, I have participated in stock market games, researched financial topics, and developed a plan for my financial future. SoFi's mission exactly aligns with my finance goals - to empower individuals to have better financial opportunities through loans, stock and retirement accounts, and user-friendly mobile and web experience. I would love to join SoFi not only to utilize my technical skills to provide value to society, but to also partake in SoFi's tight-knit culture though company events and programs like SoFi Cares.\n\nEcommerce has always been an interest of mine. Not only for personal shopping, I also love being on the seller side and creating products and web pages to provide value for others. I would love to work at nordstrom because I believe in their mission to provide the best shopping experience in a digital first platform. It would be a great opportunity to use my technical background to empower customers and brands with innovative ways to shop and sell. Some exciting potential projects I can think of are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve problems. \n\nI am interested in this role because of my passion for education, my ability to work in teams, and my previous experiences with working on projects. Though I have never had a product manager role, I would like to utilize my software development and leadership experience to break into PM.  At Duolingo, interns are trated similar to full time employees, as seen in their projects that are meaningful such as teaching Asian languages better. At the same time, Duolingo's culture encourages collaboration through events like cooking classes, duoversaries, and game nights. At Duolingo, I would gain a lot from other interns and employees from a product perspective, but also a language perspective as Duolingo features diverse and multilingual teams.\n\nDuring my time as a database software engineer intern at Van Metre companies, a real estate company in Virginia this summer, we were undergoing a lot of drastic changes at the company. For exmaplke, we were changing a lot of our on site relational databases to azure cloud databases adn also changing the tools our accounting and business analyst teams were using to upload and retrieve data. during one of our projects with the accounting team,  i noticed that they were hacing rouble understanding some of the technicalities on how our new systems worked. Noticign this, I thought of ways to explain it to them in a less complex but fully emcompassing way….. drawing ……. by doing this, it was way easiser for everyone to understand and communicate about the project requirements an details, while not missing out on key information. By dridgbng this barrier, I believe that our communcation was enhanced and our collaboration was much smoother.\n\nOne challenging problem I faced occurred during a hackathon by Northrop Grumman at my school. When introduced to the challenge, we had to create a program to ingest an image or video set to and produce a log of objects identified. There were no other guidelines about how to create this program or what it should be about, so it was very open-ended. At the time, my teammates and I did not have that much experience with object detection and machine learning at all, and this was even our first hackathon ever. To solve this, we took a very structured approach to highlight each of our personal skills as well as our teamworking ability. First, we shared with each other and researched what we knew about neural networks and training machine learning models. Then, we chose to make our solution a Where's Waldo? detector, which we implemented with preexisting libraries and neural networks such as Pytorch and YOLOv5. Some other issues that popped up along the way were not having enough data, so we had to create our own large datasets, and finetuning our model to make it as accurate as possible. In the end, we were pretty successful, and we even managed to tie our project back to implications for Northrop Grumman's business value in sectors like space, defense, and intelligence.\n\nver 2;\nOne challenging problem I faced occurred during a hackathon by Northrop Grumman at my school.

Then, we chose to make our solution a Where's Waldo? detector, which we implemented with preexisting libraries and neural networks such as Pytorch and YOLOv5. Some other problems that came up and I solved were not having enough publically available data, in which I manually labeled training and testing data, and helped to fine-tune our model to make it as accurate as possible. In the end, we were pretty successful given our time constraints, and we even managed to tie our project back to implications for Northrop Grumman's business value in sectors like space, defense, and intelligence. From this experience, I learned a lot about how many publically available technologies there are to help to implement cutting-edge ideas and that highlighting each member's strengths is a recipe for a successful group project.\n\nI am interested in 84.51 because would like to contribute to empowering companies to make better business decisions and customers to have better experiences through the power of software. I truly believe in 84.51's mission statement to help people - I want to feel that my technical work is truly providing value to the world and helping people. I am interested in the software engineer intern role because it is a field that I would like to gain more experience in and likely continue a career in. At 84.51, I believe that I can learn a lot and engage in the company's tight-knit culture.\n\nThrough my experiences, I have gained a lot of technical knowledge that fits this position's job description. I am well versed in object oriented programming languages, and have used them for projects in and out of school. I have also worked with databases, primarily at my internship last summer. I also engage in a lot of self-learning through passion projects and hackathons that I recently attended (JPMorgan Data for Good, Northrop Grumman Innovation Factory). More importantly though, I think that my ability to adapt and learn quickly as well as my proficiency with collaborating with others enables me the most for success.\n\nOutside of class, I engage in positions in clubs, organizations, and companies. For example, I am involved with the Maryland Undergraduate Research Journal, where I am a tech lead and on the executive board. I also work part time remotely at the company I interned at last summer. Further, to prepare me for a career in tech, I often do personal projects and explore topics or technologies that I am interested in.\n\nDuring my time as a database software engineer intern at Van Metre companies, a real estate company in Virginia this summer, we were undergoing a lot of drastic changes at the company.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n```\n\nOr, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want to force update your local garden (this assumed that you are okay with some of your personalizations been overriden!)\n\n```shell\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning!\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Quartz as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:jackyzha0/quartz.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss config.toml data \n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-14T18:45:39.409970748Z","tags":[]}}
